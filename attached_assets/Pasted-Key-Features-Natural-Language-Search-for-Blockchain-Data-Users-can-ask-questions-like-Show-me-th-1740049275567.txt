Key Features:
Natural Language Search for Blockchain Data

Users can ask questions like:
"Show me the top 10 Ethereum holders."
"Find the largest transactions in the last 7 days."
"Which wallet interacted with Uniswap the most?"
The LLM converts these queries into structured blockchain queries.
Ethereum Data Integration

Fetch real-time data from blockchain explorers (Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode).
Store historical data in a database for fast querying.
Custom Fine-Tuned LLM

A lightweight model trained/fine-tuned on Ethereum transaction patterns, smart contract interactions, and common blockchain search queries.
Efficient Indexing & Query Processing

Index on-chain data to speed up response times.
Use graph-based analysis for entity relationships (e.g., which accounts are frequently transacting with each other).
Web-based UI or API

A simple web app or API where users input queries and get structured blockchain insights.
Technologies Required:
1. Blockchain Data Sources
Etherscan API (for transaction, address, and contract data)
Infura/Alchemy/QuickNode (for raw on-chain data)
The Graph (for querying indexed blockchain data efficiently)
Ethereum Full Node (Optional, for deeper analysis)
2. Language Model (LLM)
LLM Options:

OpenAI's GPT-4 fine-tuned for Ethereum data.
Llama 2 / Mistral (open-source, self-hosted models).
Fine-tuned T5/BERT for structured blockchain queries.
Fine-Tuning / Training:

Dataset: Historical Etherscan data, labeled blockchain queries.
Embeddings: FAISS for fast search & retrieval of transaction patterns.
3. Data Storage & Indexing
PostgreSQL (for structured storage of accounts, transactions, tokens)
ElasticSearch (for text-based search & fast retrieval)
Redis (for caching frequently accessed queries)
Neo4j (optional, for graph-based wallet/contract analysis)
4. Backend & API
FastAPI / Flask (for serving LLM and query results)
GraphQL (if using The Graph for on-chain data queries)
LangChain (for LLM-powered search pipelines)
5. Frontend (Optional)
React / Next.js (if building a web interface)
ShadCN / TailwindCSS (for UI components)
D3.js / Recharts (for blockchain data visualization)
